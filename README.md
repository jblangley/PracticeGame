# PracticeGame
A basic game of spells and monsters. It uses the Console Application to play. This is one of my first projects that got a bit bigger 
than I expected so the code isn't as clean as I'd like now but it's perfectly functional as is and am quite proud of it, enjoy!

You are Hiro, on an text based fighter ready to take on any enemy in your way! To play:

1) Download and extract the zip file. 
2) Double click "Game.exe"
3) To navigate the game input a number followed by the enter key. example of a game follows (keystroke; next keystroke)
  a) Lets start the game.
    > 1; ENTER; 
  b) From here we can choose what enemy we can face from basic grunts to a boos or an elemental. We could even use Army Creation
  to face different enemies all at once or allow Random Match to pick for us. For now lets pick the the Wolf.
    > 2; ENTER;
  c) Now we can see our health, the wolf's health and an option to exit. This is screen is for choosing which enemy to fight if there are 
  multiple. Since its just a lone wolf we'll focus on him.
    > 1; ENTER;
  d) Again we can see our health and our opponent's along with how many spells we can cast and how many potions we can heal with.
  This now makes our options for the action we are taking against the wolf. We can attack, cast fire, cast ice, or use a potion to heal.
  Lets use the Attack option.
    > 1; ENTER;
  e) Alright! 12 damage dealt to the Wolf, but he got us back for 15. Lets see what to do next.
    > ENTER;
  f)  Select Wolf again.
    > 1; ENTER;
  g) We did some damage with that attack but lets try casting fire!
    > 2; ENTER;
  h) That did a twice more damage! And you may have gotten the bonus 15 in too! Though the Wolf still got us for 15 again. Lets keep at 
  that Wolf!
    > ENTER
  i) Select Wolf again and try the ice this time!
    > 1; ENTER; 3; ENTER;
  j) Now we've got him down by 15 more! one or two more attacks should do it! Hey might have gotten that attack bonus freezing the
  Wolf and US not getting any damage this turn.
    > ENTER
  k) Finish the Wolf off with any of your attacks.
    > 1; ENTER; ATTACK #; ENTER; ENTER;// Repeat until you win!
  l) You beat the big bad wolf! Good Job! You'll go back to the Start menu and can choose to take on a new enemy or group of enemies.
  Please enjoy!
  
  NOTE: The ice didn't get to show is full potential till you're in against a group of enemies, so give it a try!
